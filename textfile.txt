I played this game way too much. If you played an rts game years ago, you probably felt that you wanted to control less units, and for them to be way stronger. So your dreams have come true. Every match you choose a unit that is so hilariously overpowered. An immortal hero of legend that could single-handedly destroy any army in an rts game. Except there are a handful of others that can match your power.
Play with strangers or play with friends, but either way this game will make you feel every emotion, but stronger, and no matter how skilled you get- there is always somebody who will come out of nowhere and completely cream you. If you only play one game, play this game. If you play a lot of games, then enjoy this every once in awhile for variety, it's fun.
